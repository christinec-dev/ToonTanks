# ToonTanks
Toon Tanks is a simple tanks inspired game made with Unreal Engine and C++. The main purpose of the game is to destroy all the enemy turrets. This is a beta version of the game, made from the ground up by me during the Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games course on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/. The assets that I used to build my map were found on the Unreal Engine Marketplace, namely the Assetsville Town Pack. The game uses various mechanics, effects, and blueprints, and I really had a fun time setting up the actors' movement and shooting capabilities, as well as building my world, it reminded me of The Sims! ðŸ˜€
